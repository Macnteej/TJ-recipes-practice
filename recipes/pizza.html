        <h3>Description</h3>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul style="font-size: 30px; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">
                <li>3 1/2 cups of flour</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (95-105 degrees f)</li>
                <li>1/2 TBSP sugar</li>
                <li>1 TSP salt</li>
                <li>2 1/4 TBSP Active Dry Yeast</li>
                <li>8 ounces of tomato sauce</li>
                <li>8 ounces of shredded mozzarella</li>
                <li>toppings of your choosing</li>
                <li>Optional: 1 TBSP olive oil</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps for making dough</h2>
        <ol style="font-size: 30px; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">
                <li>In a bowl or standmixer combine your flour, sugar, salt, and optional olive oil. Begin mixing on low speed to stir ingredients together.</li>
                <li>In a separate container, begin mixing your 1 1/2 cups of water with your yeast. Allow yeast to bloom for 3-5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once the yeast has bloomed pour the mixture into the dry ingredients. Begin mixing until the dough begins to form a ball.</li>
                <li>Once dough is formed, lightly flour a work surface and begin kneading the dough until it begins to become smooth</li>
                <li>Once smooth, lather the dough with Olive oil and place in a mixing bowl 2.5 times its size and cover with plastic wrap. Allow to rise for 6 hours, or overnight at room temperature (inside of an oven that is off with the oven light on is best)</li>
                <li>Once it has doubled in size, push down on the center of the dough and deflate the ball. Pour onto a lightly floured work surface and begin to separate the dough into 4 even pieces.</li>
                <li>Roll the 4 pieces individually into new dough balls</li>
                <li>Once cut and rolled, either put in containers for freezing, for refrigeration for the next day, or let rise for one hour before making the pizza.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Steps to make pizza</h2>
        <ol style="font-size: 30px; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif">
            <li>Begin by preheating your oven to the highest temperature it can go. Ideally at least 500 degrees with a baking stone for one hour.</li>
            <li>When the oven has preheated, dust your dough with flour and begin to stretch the dough to the size you want.</li>
            <li>Once stretched, place the stretched dough onto a pizza peel and begin to spread a layer of sauce onto the dough evenly.</li>
            <li>Once evenly spread, begin to sprinkle the cheese onto the pizza however thick or thin you desire.</li>
            <li>Once the cheese is spread begin to add the toppings of your choosing.</li>
            <li>Once ready to bake the pizza, give the peel a slight shake to confirm if it will slide off easily. If sticking, pick up an edge and lightly blow under the dough and sprinkle more flour underneath.</li>
            <li>When launching the pizza into the oven, aim for the center of the baking stone, and launch with one smooth push.</li>
            <li>Once on the stone, let pizza bake for 3-4 minutes and then rotate 180 degrees and bake for another 3-4 minutes</li>
            <li>When pulling the pizza out after 6-8 minutes, or when browned to your liking, let the pizza rest for 2 minutes before cutting</li>
            <li>With a pizza cutter or knife, slice the pizza into as many even slices as you want.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
